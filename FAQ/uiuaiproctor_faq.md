@TPC_member(DIU Student)  I cannot find the About section. Could you explain what the project is about?

It's an AI based proctorial service that uses RAG system to manage bilingual query on proctorial docs,protocol both in call and chat mode. Also it handle priority based appointment setup with proctor. It designed to support 24/7 proctorial service.

is it a QnA service?

Not exactly QnA. Let's describe with a scenario.

-> Let's say, it's night of 1 am and proctor office is not reachable but you need emergency help like you faced ragging. You don't know what to do. Who can help you. Maybe ask aiproctor for appointment and send proves. 
Or maybe you lost something and need cctv footage. Ask there. Maybe you are having issue with legal support. You need to know How to get help. And every situation, you need to inform authority so best thing you can use this service.

This is the overall use case idea.
