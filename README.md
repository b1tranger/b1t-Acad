For now it's just a Google Drive Folder containing all the <i><small>(bare-minimum?)</small></i> necessary resources throughout BSc in CSE Program in UITS.
Although, under UGC, many of the resources can be found being common in many other universities.

I plan to make a website which can <b>host</b> all of these <b>independent of Google's Ecosystem</b>. It's a huge project, and decided on my own accord. Meaning it's <b><u>unofficial and not officially affiliated</u></b> with UITS. As such, anyone is free to recreate and reuse the materials in it (granted the legal issues are their own responsibility).

I hope this helps many others at least to find their needs a bit more organized. Good Luck!
