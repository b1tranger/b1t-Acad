## 📖 About The Project

**b1t Academics** is a comprehensive, student-maintained archive for UITS (University) resources. It serves as a central hub for course materials, question banks, class routines, and academic guidelines, aiming to solve the fragmentation of resources across different platforms.

> **Note**: This is an independent, personal project and is **NOT** officially affiliated with UITS. It is maintained by students, for students.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **📂 Department Browser**: A dedicated section to browse resources filtered by Department (CSE, CE, IT, BBA) and Semester.
-   **📚 Digital Library**: Curated collections of books, software guides, and external learning resources (e.g., FMHY, Islamic Books).
-   **📝 Question Bank**: A growing archive of past exam questions to help with preparation.
-   **🎨 Dynamic Theming**: Fully responsive UI with support for **Dark Mode** (default) and a high-contrast **Gray/Light Mode**.
-   **🤝 Community Contribution**: built-in forms for students to donate notes, questions, and even blood (via BDN integration).
